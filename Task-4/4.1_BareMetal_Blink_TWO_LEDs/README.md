# Task 4.1 – Bare Metal Blink Two LEDs

## Objective
To blink two LEDs using direct register manipulation without Arduino
functions.

## LEDs Used
- PORTB5 → Arduino Pin 13
- PORTD7 → Arduino Pin 7

## Description
This experiment demonstrates bare-metal programming by configuring
DDR and PORT registers directly to blink LEDs connected to PORTB5
and PORTD7 of ATmega328P.
