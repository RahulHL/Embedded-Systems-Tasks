# Task 2.1 – LED Toggle Using External Interrupt

## Objective
To toggle an LED using an external interrupt generated by a push button.

## Components Required
- Arduino UNO
- Push button
- LED
- 220Ω resistor
- 10kΩ resistor
- Breadboard
- Jumper wires

## Description
In this experiment, a push button is connected to an external interrupt pin.
Whenever the button is pressed, an interrupt is generated and the LED toggles
