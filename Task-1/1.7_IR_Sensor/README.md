# Task 1.7 – IR Sensor Object Detection

## Objective
To detect the presence of an object using an IR sensor and indicate it using an LED.

## Components Required
- Arduino UNO
- IR sensor module
- LED
- 220Ω resistor
- Breadboard
- Jumper wires

## Description
In this experiment, an IR sensor module is used to detect the presence of an object.
When an object is detected, the sensor output changes and the LED is turned ON.
If no object is detected, the LED remains OFF.

## Output
The LED turns ON when an object is detected by the IR sensor.
