# Task 1.5 – PWM LED Brightness Control

## Objective
To vary the brightness of an LED from minimum to maximum and back using PWM.

## Components Required
- Arduino UNO
- LED
- 220Ω resistor
- Breadboard
- Jumper wires

## Description
In this experiment, the brightness of an LED is controlled using the
analogWrite() function. PWM values are varied gradually to increase
and decrease the LED brightness smoothly.

## Output
The LED brightness increases gradually from dim to bright and then decreases.
