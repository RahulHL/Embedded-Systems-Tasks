# Task 1.9 – LED Control Using Push Button AND IR Sensor

## Objective
To turn an LED ON only when both a push button is pressed and an IR sensor detects an object.

## Components Required
- Arduino UNO
- Push button
- IR sensor module
- LED
- 220Ω resistor
- 10kΩ resistor
- Breadboard
- Jumper wires

## Description
In this experiment, two input devices are used: a push button and an IR sensor.
The LED is turned ON only when both inputs are active simultaneously.
Logical AND operation is used to combine the two conditions.

## Output
The LED turns ON only when the push button is pressed and the IR sensor detects an object.
