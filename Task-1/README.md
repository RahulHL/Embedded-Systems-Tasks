# Task 1 – Embedded Systems Basics

This folder contains a set of basic embedded system experiments implemented as part of laboratory work.

## List of Experiments
1. LED Blink using delay()
2. Turn an LED ON when a push button is pressed and OFF when released.
3. Toggle an LED state each time a push button is pressed.
4. Connect three LEDs and create a running light pattern from left to right.
5. Use analogWrite() to fade an LED brightness from minimum to maximum and back.
6. Use a push button to change LED brightness between low, medium, and high levels.
7. Turn an LED ON when the IR sensor detects an object.
8. Blink an LED the same number of times an object is detected by the IR sensor.
9. Turn an LED ON only when both push button is pressed and IR sensor detects an object.1
10. Use IR sensor as a security trigger: LED keeps blinking until a reset button is pressed.
Platform Used:
- Arduino UNO
- Embedded C
