# Task 1.8 – LED Blink Based on IR Sensor Count

## Objective
To blink an LED the same number of times as the number of objects detected by an IR sensor.

## Components Required
- Arduino UNO
- IR sensor module
- LED
- 220Ω resistor
- Breadboard
- Jumper wires

## Description
In this experiment, the IR sensor detects objects and increments a counter
each time an object is detected. The LED blinks a number of times equal to
the total count of detected objects.

## Output
The LED blinks proportionally to the number of objects detected by the IR sensor.
